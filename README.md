  + If you still want a open source alternative, I recommend using [FerretDB](https://www.github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB) but you'll have to change some code in the project.

## üîß Installation

   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   JWT_EXPIRE=30d
   ```

   Create `.env` in the client directory:
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
   REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:5000
   ```

4. **Start the application**
